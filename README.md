This is a crossword puzzle to go with my crossword solver program CrosswordHelper on python!
My crossword helper wound up not working to help with crosswords I found onine, but it did still support hosting a local website 
which could be useful for other applications. The python code is in a text file named crosswordsolverpy.py.
